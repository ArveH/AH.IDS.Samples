# Sample clients and api's for setting up authentication

Here are some samples on how to setup authentication using Unit4 Identity Services. I created ASP.NET Web App's and API's in .NET Core 3.1, .NET6 and .NET7. The setup doesn't really change much between the different versions of .NET.

The samples are based on the samples you find in the Duende documentation, but I added some buttons to test that CORS works.
